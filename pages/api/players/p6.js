The fact that two of his three managers over the course of the year have been sacked and the third, Portugal's Fernando Santos, is hanging by a thread suggests that the teams with him in have not been quite as successful, but the five-time Ballon d'Or winner still has the capability to come up big with goals on a regular basis."
